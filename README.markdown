In this program, I have created a site that allows you to:
  a) create new tasks, using a form
  b) view tasks that have been created

  This application uses primarily the Sinatra and Shotgun gems, which allow us to run a server and make changes to the code base without restarting.  It also uses YAML to store data.

For more details of the function of each line, check comments.
